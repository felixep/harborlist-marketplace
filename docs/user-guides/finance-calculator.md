- **Interest**: Cost of borrowing money
- **Insurance**: Boat insurance (if included)
- **Taxes**: Sales tax (if financed)

### Total Cost Analysis
Consider these factors:
- **Total Interest**: Cost of financing over the loan term
- **Opportunity Cost**: What else you could do with the down payment
- **Depreciation**: How the boat's value changes over time

### Interest Rate Impact
Small rate differences have big impacts:
- 1% rate increase = ~$50-100 more per month (typical boat loan)
- Shop around with multiple lenders
- Consider credit union rates

## Tips for Better Financing

### Improving Your Loan Terms
1. **Higher Down Payment**: Reduces loan amount and monthly payments
2. **Shorter Term**: Higher monthly payment but less total interest
3. **Better Credit Score**: Qualifies you for lower interest rates
4. **Shop Around**: Compare rates from multiple lenders

### Loan Term Considerations
- **Shorter Terms (5-10 years)**: Higher payments, less interest
- **Longer Terms (15-20 years)**: Lower payments, more interest
- **Sweet Spot**: Often 10-15 years for most buyers

### Down Payment Strategies
- **20% Down**: Traditional recommendation, avoids PMI
- **10% Down**: Lower upfront cost, higher monthly payments
- **Cash Purchase**: No interest, but ties up capital
