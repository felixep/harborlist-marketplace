# Owner Listing Management Features

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **OwnerListingCard Component** (`frontend/src/components/listing/OwnerListingCard.tsx`)
A comprehensive listing management card for boat owners with the following features:

#### Visual Features:
- **Status Badges with Icons**: Clear visual indicators for listing status
  - ‚úÖ Active (green)
  - ‚è≥ Pending Review (yellow)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Changes Requested (orange)
  - ‚ùå Rejected (red)
  - üéâ Sold (gray)
- **View Counter**: Display number of views with eye icon
- **Moderation Alerts**: Shows moderator feedback for listings requiring changes
- **Stats Footer**: Views, Inquiries, and Listing Date

#### Management Actions:

**Primary Actions:**
- **View**: Navigate to the listing detail page
- **Edit**: Go to edit page to modify listing details

**More Actions Menu:**
- **Mark as Sold**: Change listing status to sold (with confirmation)
- **Reactivate Listing**: Restore sold listings to active status
- **Copy Link**: Copy listing URL to clipboard
- **Share on Facebook**: Direct social media sharing
- **Delete Listing**: Remove listing permanently (with confirmation modal)

### 2. **Owner-Only Listings API** (Backend)
Updated `getListings` function to support `ownerId` query parameter:
- Filters listings by owner using the OwnerIndex GSI for performance
- Returns ALL listings (including pending moderation) for the owner
- Secured: Users can only query their own listings
- Includes full listing details with owner information

### 3. **Route Fixes**
- Fixed slug route ordering in local server to properly handle `/api/listings/slug/:slug`
- Added authentication logging for debugging

### 4. **Edit Listing Page** (`frontend/src/pages/EditListing.tsx`)
- Placeholder page for editing listings
- Fetches current listing data
- Uses existing ListingForm component
- Proper error handling and loading states

### 5. **Updated Profile Page**
- Now uses `OwnerListingCard` instead of generic `ListingCard`
- Passes `ownerId` parameter to backend to fetch only user's listings
- Shows all listing statuses (pending, active, sold, etc.)

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to Profile**: Go to `/profile` to see all your listings

2. **View Listing Stats**: 
   - See view count, inquiries, and listing date
   - Check current status (Pending, Active, Sold, etc.)

3. **Manage Listings**:
   - Click **View** to see the full listing page
   - Click **Edit** to modify listing details (opens `/edit/:id`)
   - Click **More Actions** for additional options

5. **Delete Listing**:

6. **Share Listing**:

7. **Reactivate Sold Listing**:
   - If marked as sold, can reactivate from More Actions menu

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints Used:
- `GET /api/listings?ownerId={userId}` - Fetch user's listings
- `PUT /api/listings/{id}` - Update listing (mark as sold, reactivate)
- `DELETE /api/listings/{id}` - Delete listing

### Security:
- All actions require authentication
- Users can only manage their own listings
- Backend validates ownership before allowing updates/deletes

### Status Flow:
```
Created ‚Üí Pending Review ‚Üí (Approved) ‚Üí Active ‚Üí Sold
                      ‚Üì
                 Changes Requested ‚Üí (Updated) ‚Üí Pending Review
                      ‚Üì
                  Rejected (can be deleted)
```
