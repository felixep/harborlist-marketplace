## �🛠️ **Prerequisites**

Before using these tools, ensure you have the required dependencies:

### **Core Requirements**
- **AWS CLI** (v2.x+) configured with appropriate credentials
- **Node.js** (v18+) for JavaScript-based tools  
- **Bash** shell environment (macOS/Linux)
- **AWS CDK CLI** (v2.x+) for infrastructure operations

### **Tool-Specific Requirements**
- **Cloudflare API credentials** for CDN management tools
- **Admin permissions** for infrastructure validation tools
- **Monitoring setup** for performance and health check tools
- **Cost management permissions** for billing analysis tools

## 📖 Usage Patterns

### Standard Deployment Workflow
```bash
# 1. Deploy infrastructure
./infrastructure/scripts/deploy.sh dev

# 2. Verify deployment
./infrastructure/scripts/verify-deployment.sh

# 3. Set up monitoring  
./infrastructure/scripts/setup-monitoring.sh

# 4. Run performance tests
./infrastructure/scripts/run-performance-tests.sh
```

### Monitoring Workflow
```bash
# 1. Check system health
./infrastructure/scripts/test-monitoring.sh

# 2. Analyze costs
node ./infrastructure/scripts/cost-analysis.js

# 3. Generate reports
node ./infrastructure/scripts/dev-environment-status-report.js
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **Environment Variables**: Many scripts require environment-specific configuration
- **Permissions**: Ensure proper AWS IAM permissions for script operations
- **Dependencies**: Some scripts have interdependencies and should be run in sequence
- **Logging**: All scripts generate detailed logs for troubleshooting

## 📞 Support

For issues with infrastructure scripts:
1. Check the individual script documentation
2. Review the generated logs in the `infrastructure/reports/` directory
3. Validate AWS credentials and permissions
4. Ensure all prerequisites are installed
