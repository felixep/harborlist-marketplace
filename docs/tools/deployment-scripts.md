   - Validates frontend accessibility
   - Verifies database connectivity

6. **Reporting**
   - Generates deployment summary
   - Provides access URLs and configuration details
   - Offers troubleshooting guidance

### Output
```bash
‚úÖ Deployment completed successfully!

## üìù Best Practices

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Always deploy to dev environment first**
2. **Run verification after each deployment**
3. **Use dry-run for production deployments**
4. **Monitor logs during deployment process**
5. **Keep rollback procedures ready**

### Environment Management
- Use environment-specific configuration files
- Validate prerequisites before deployment
- Monitor resource costs after deployment
- Implement proper access controls
- Document environment-specific settings

### Security Considerations
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use least-privilege IAM policies
- Enable audit logging
- Validate SSL certificates
- Monitor security events

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| AWS credentials not found | Missing or expired AWS credentials | Run `aws configure` or check IAM permissions |
| CDK bootstrap missing | CDK not bootstrapped for region | Run `cdk bootstrap` |
| Domain not accessible | DNS not propagated | Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours) |
| Lambda deployment fails | Package size too large | Optimize dependencies or use Lambda layers |
| Frontend not loading | S3 bucket policy incorrect | Check bucket policy and CloudFront configuration |

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check AWS configuration
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Validate CDK setup
cdk ls

# Check CloudFormation status
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name BoatListingStack-dev

# Test API endpoints
curl -I https://api-dev.harborlist.com/health

# Check frontend accessibility
curl -I https://dev.harborlist.com
```
