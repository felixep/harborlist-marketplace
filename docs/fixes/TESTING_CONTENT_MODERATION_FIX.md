# Content Moderation Fix - Testing Guide

## ✅ Changes Applied

The backend has been updated and restarted with the following fixes:

### Fixed Functions:
1. **`handleGetFlaggedListings`** - Now queries for `pending_moderation` status
2. **`handleGetModerationStats`** - Now counts both `pending_moderation` and `pending_review` 
3. **`getRealListingsData`** - Now properly queries the `status` field instead of `moderationStatus`

### Backend Status:
- ✅ Code changes applied
- ✅ Service restarted successfully
- ✅ Server running on: http://local-api.harborlist.com:3001

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Verify Current Pending Listings
```bash
# Check if you have any pending listings in the database
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  http://local-api.harborlist.com:3001/api/admin/listings/flagged
```

### Step 2: Check Moderation Stats
```bash
# Verify the pending count is now accurate
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  http://local-api.harborlist.com:3001/api/admin/moderation/stats
```

### Step 3: Test in Admin Portal UI
1. **Login to Admin Portal:**
   - Go to: http://local.harborlist.com:3000/admin
   - Use your admin credentials

2. **Navigate to Content Moderation:**
   - Click on "Content Moderation" in the sidebar
   - You should now see all pending listings

3. **Verify Listings Appear:**
   - Check that listings with `status: 'pending_moderation'` are visible
   - Verify the "Pending Review" count is accurate
   - Try filtering by status

### Step 4: Create a New Test Listing
1. **Login as Regular User:**
   - Logout from admin account
   - Login as a regular customer

2. **Create New Listing:**
   - Go to "Create Listing" or "Sell Your Boat"
   - Fill out the form and submit

3. **Verify in Admin Portal:**
   - Login back as admin
   - Go to Content Moderation
   - The new listing should appear immediately in the queue

### Step 5: Test Moderation Actions
1. **Select a Pending Listing:**
   - Click on a listing in the moderation queue

2. **Review and Take Action:**
   - View the listing details
   - Try approving or rejecting
   - Verify status updates correctly

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### The Problem:
Listings were created with `status: 'pending_moderation'` but the admin queries were looking for `status: 'pending_review'`, causing a mismatch.

### The Solution:
Updated all admin service queries to include both:
- `status: 'pending_moderation'` (current standard)
- `status: 'pending_review'` (legacy support)

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Pending listings: 0 (even though some exist)
- ❌ Moderation queue: Empty
- ❌ Stats show 0 pending

### After Fix:
- ✅ Pending listings: Shows all listings with pending status
- ✅ Moderation queue: Displays all pending listings
- ✅ Stats show accurate count

## 🐛 If Issues Persist

### Check Database Records:
```bash
# Use DynamoDB Admin to check listing status values
# URL: http://localhost:8001
# Look for listings and verify their 'status' field
```

### Check Backend Logs:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.application.yml -f docker-compose.infrastructure.yml logs -f backend
```

### Verify the Status Field:
Look for these patterns in listings:
```json
{
  "status": "pending_moderation",  // ← Should match query now
  "moderationWorkflow": {
    "status": "pending_review"
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **No Database Changes Required** - This is a query-level fix only
2. **Backward Compatible** - Still supports legacy `pending_review` status
3. **Frontend Unchanged** - Only backend queries were modified
4. **Immediate Effect** - Changes are live after backend restart

## 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ All pending listings visible in Content Moderation  
✅ Accurate pending count in statistics  
✅ Can approve/reject listings from queue  
✅ New listings appear immediately in queue  
✅ No errors in backend logs
