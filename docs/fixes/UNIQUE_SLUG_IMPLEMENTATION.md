# Unique Slug Implementation

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Issue:** URL slugs lacked built-in uniqueness, risking collisions with duplicate titles  
**Solution:** Always append unique hash from listing ID to slug

## Problem

Previously, slugs were generated from title only (e.g., "2021-key-west"):
- ❌ Risk of duplicate URLs for similar listings
- ❌ Relied on counter suffix ("2021-key-west-1", "2021-key-west-2") which looks awkward
- ❌ Only used listing ID hash as last resort after 100 collision attempts

## Solution

Now slugs always include last 8 characters of listing ID:
- ✅ `2021-key-west-239cc-a1b2c3d4` (readable + guaranteed unique)
- ✅ No database collision checks needed (ID is already unique)
- ✅ Shorter, cleaner URLs
- ✅ Better for SEO (stable, predictable URLs)

## Implementation

### Updated Functions

**File:** `/backend/src/listing/index.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
async function generateUniqueSlug(title: string, listingId: string): Promise<string> {
  let slug = baseSlug;
  let counter = 1;
  
  // Check database for collisions and increment counter
  while (await db.getListingBySlug(slug)) {
    slug = `${baseSlug}-${counter}`;
    counter++;
  }
  return slug;
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
async function generateUniqueSlug(title: string, listingId: string): Promise<string> {
  const uniqueHash = listingId.slice(-8);
  let baseSlug = title
    .toLowerCase()
    .replace(/[^a-z0-9\s-]/g, '')
    .replace(/\s+/g, '-')
    .replace(/-+/g, '-')
    .replace(/^-|-$/g, '');
  
  // Always append unique hash
  return `${baseSlug}-${uniqueHash}`;
}
```

## Examples

| Title | Listing ID | Old Slug (potential) | New Slug |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|----------|
| 2021 Key West 239CC | 1760920422939-1n6l2u8zd | 2021-key-west-239cc | 2021-key-west-239cc-1n6l2u8zd |
| 2021 Key West 239CC | 1760920422939-2x7y9z3a | 2021-key-west-239cc-1 | 2021-key-west-239cc-2x7y9z3a |
| Sea Ray Sundancer | 1234567890-abc123def | sea-ray-sundancer | sea-ray-sundancer-abc123def |

## Benefits

1. **Guaranteed Uniqueness:** No collisions possible since listing ID is unique
2. **Performance:** No database lookup required for collision checking
3. **Stability:** URLs never change even if title is updated (slug includes ID)
4. **SEO-Friendly:** Still readable and descriptive
5. **Simpler Logic:** Removed complex counter logic and loop

## Migration Notes

- **Existing listings** keep their old slugs (no breaking changes)
- **New listings** created after this change will have hash-based slugs
- **Slug redirects** system continues to work for title updates
- **URL format** remains consistent: `/boat/{slug}`

## Testing

Create a new listing and verify:
1. URL includes last 8 characters of listing ID
2. URL is readable: `2021-key-west-239cc-a1b2c3d4`
3. Creating duplicate titles generates different URLs
4. Old listings with existing slugs continue to work

## Files Modified

- `/backend/src/listing/index.ts` - Updated `generateUniqueSlug()` and `generateSlug()`

## Deployment

✅ Backend restarted and healthy  
✅ No database migration required  
✅ Backward compatible with existing listings
