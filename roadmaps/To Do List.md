When login, all users should land on their listings if there is any. 

Users
- The service will serve two type of customers, individuals and dealers. In addition I would have the option of premiun membership. Let's create the capabilities to handle different types of users and the toolings to manage it under the admin page. Lets create a role on the system for sales as well with the capacity to pick and shose the capabilities for each type of customer and what's included in the premium plans. Admins and Super_Admins should be able to do the same as well.

Listing flow
 - All listings done on the page should be reviewed by the content_moderation, admin and super_admin groups before publishing.
