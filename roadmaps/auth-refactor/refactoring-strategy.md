# AWS Cognito Dual-Pool Refactoring Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for refactoring the HarborList boat marketplace authentication system from a custom JWT-based solution to AWS Cognito with dual User Pools for customers and staff.

## Strategic Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Dual Authentication Domains**: Separate Customer and Staff authentication with independent security policies
2. **Enhanced Security**: Leverage AWS Cognito's built-in security features (MFA, password policies, account lockout)
3. **Simplified Maintenance**: Reduce custom authentication code and leverage managed services
4. **Scalability**: Improve system scalability with AWS Cognito's managed infrastructure
5. **Compliance**: Enhanced audit logging and compliance features

### Secondary Goals
1. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing admin interface without duplication
2. **Local Development**: Seamless local development with LocalStack Cognito
3. **Performance**: Maintain or improve authentication performance
4. **Cost Optimization**: Optimize costs while improving functionality
