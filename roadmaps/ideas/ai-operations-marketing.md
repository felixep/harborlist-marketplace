## 📅 Phase
**Milestone:** Q2–Q3 2026  
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** High  
**Owner:** Growth Intelligence Team

- Identify and prioritize high-intent buyers and active sellers.  
- Personalize communication at scale using behavioral and contextual signals.  
- Continuously analyze platform activity to improve conversion and retention.

## 🧠 Key Features

### 1. Smart Lead Scoring (Predictive ML)
- Train a classification model on listing views, message activity, and conversions.  
- Output a **lead likelihood score (0–1)** per buyer/seller.  
- Use scores to trigger automated workflows (follow-ups, priority routing).  
- **Stack:** SageMaker XGBoost / Autopilot → DynamoDB → EventBridge → Pinpoint.

---

### 2. AI Auto-Reply & Follow-Up Assistant
- Generate fast, accurate responses to buyer inquiries using LLMs (Bedrock: Claude or GPT-4o).  
- Context window includes listing details, price, region, and prior messages.  
- Tone controlled via prompt templates (“friendly professional broker tone”).  
- Human approval option for dealers or premium users.

---

### 3. Personalized Outreach & Nurture Campaigns
- Dynamically segment users by intent and lifecycle stage.  
- Generate **personalized email & push content**:  
  - “Hi Mike, prices for 24’ walkarounds dropped 5% near Miami this month.”  
- Run A/B testing on AI-generated subject lines and creatives.  
- **Stack:** Amazon Pinpoint + Bedrock + Redshift ML (for segmentation).

---

### 4. Generative SEO & Content Engine
- Automatically produce SEO-optimized blog posts and localized landing pages.  
- Examples:  
  - *“Top 10 Offshore Boats Under $40K in South Florida”*  
  - *“2025 Used Outboard Market Trends Report”*  
- Enrichment via structured data from your price engine and analytics layer.  
- Output Markdown → reviewed → auto-published to HarborList blog via CMS API.

---

### 5. Conversational Insights Dashboard
- LLM-powered internal assistant (“HarborBot”) for operations teams:  
  - “Which listing categories saw the highest CTR last week?”  
  - “Generate report: leads by region vs average sale price.”  
- Connects to Redshift / Athena with secure RAG pipeline.
