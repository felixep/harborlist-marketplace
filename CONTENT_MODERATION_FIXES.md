# Content Moderation Section Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Backend Endpoints (404 Errors)
- ✅ Added `/api/admin/listings/flagged` endpoint for fetching flagged listings
- ✅ Added `/api/admin/system/alerts` endpoint for system alerts
- ✅ Added `/api/admin/system/errors` endpoint for error tracking
- ✅ Added `/api/admin/listings/{id}` endpoint for listing details

### 2. Frontend Component Issues
- ✅ Fixed `healthChecks?.map is not a function` error in SystemMonitoring component
- ✅ Added proper null/undefined checks for healthChecks array
- ✅ Added loading states and error handling

### 3. Environment-Aware Implementation
- ✅ Updated system health endpoint to return proper data structure expected by frontend
- ✅ Made all endpoints environment-aware (local vs AWS)
- ✅ Integrated with existing dashboard data structure
- ✅ Added proper deployment context detection

### 4. Backend Handler Functions Added

#### `handleGetFlaggedListings`
- Fetches flagged/pending listings from database
- Supports filtering by status and priority
- Returns proper listing data structure with moderation info

#### `handleGetSystemAlerts`
- Environment-aware alert generation
- Different alerts for local vs AWS environments
- Proper alert categorization and metadata

#### `handleGetSystemErrors`
- Environment-specific error reporting
- Minimal errors for local development
- Comprehensive error tracking for production

#### `handleGetListingDetails`
- Detailed listing information for moderation
- Complete boat specifications and seller info
- Moderation history and notes

### 5. System Health Integration
- ✅ Updated `handleGetSystemHealth` to return frontend-expected structure
- ✅ Environment-aware health checks (local vs AWS services)
- ✅ Proper service status reporting with response times
- ✅ Integration with existing dashboard metrics

### 6. System Metrics Enhancement
- ✅ Made `handleGetSystemMetrics` environment-aware
- ✅ Scaled metrics appropriately for local vs production
- ✅ Updated time series data generation for environment context

## Environment Differences

### Local Environment
- Simplified service health checks
- Mock email/search/cache services
- Lower resource usage metrics
- Development-focused alerts
- Minimal error reporting

### AWS Environment
- Full AWS service integration
- Production-level metrics
- Comprehensive alerting
- Real error tracking
- Performance monitoring

## Integration Points

### Dashboard Data
- System health data integrates with existing dashboard metrics
- Consistent data structure across all admin endpoints
- Environment context preserved throughout

### Frontend Components
- SystemMonitoring component now handles undefined data gracefully
- ErrorTrackingPanel gets proper error data
- ModerationQueue gets real flagged listings data
- All components work in both local and AWS environments

## Testing

Created `backend/test-admin-endpoints.js` for endpoint verification:
- Tests all new endpoints
- Handles both HTTP and HTTPS
- Proper error reporting
- Timeout handling

## Next Steps

1. Test the endpoints in your local environment
2. Verify the admin dashboard loads without errors
3. Check that moderation queue shows proper data
4. Confirm system monitoring displays correctly
5. Test in both local and AWS environments

The content moderation section should now be fully functional with proper environment awareness and integration with existing dashboard data.
